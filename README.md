## Overview

This is the official implementation of our NeurIPS 2025 paper. We propose a novel diffusion-based regularization approach for safe offline reinforcement learning that maintains safety constraints without sacrificing performance. Our method leverages diffusion models to learn safe behavioral priors from offline datasets, enabling effective constraint satisfaction in challenging safety-critical scenarios.

**Key Features:**
- 🎯 Diffusion-based policy regularization for constrained offline RL
- 🛡️ Safety constraint satisfaction without performance degradation
- 📊 State-of-the-art results on safety-critical benchmarks
- 🚀 Easy-to-use implementation with comprehensive documentation

A Safe Reinforcement Learning implementation using Diffusion Policies for constrained environments. This project combines the power of diffusion models with safe reinforcement learning to learn policies that respect safety constraints during both training and deployment.

## Overview

Safe Diffusion RL addresses the challenge of learning safe policies in offline reinforcement learning settings. The method uses diffusion models to represent stochastic policies while incorporating safety constraints through a dual critic architecture (reward and cost critics).

## Features

- 🛡️ **Safety-First**: Incorporates safety constraints directly into the learning process
- 🎯 **Diffusion Policies**: Uses score-based diffusion models for expressive policy representation
- 📊 **Dual Critic Architecture**: Separate reward and cost critics for balanced optimization
- 🏃 **Offline RL**: Learn from pre-collected datasets without environment interaction
- 🔧 **Modular Design**: Clean separation between agents, environments, and utilities

## Environment Setup

We recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast and reliable Python environment management.

### Prerequisites

## Quick Start

### 1. Prepare Model Checkpoints

Download pretrained behavior and critic checkpoints and store them under `./Safe_model_factory/`, or train them yourself:

**Train Behavior Policy:**
```bash
TASK="OfflineCarCircle-v0"
seed=0
python safe_behavior.py --expid ${TASK}-baseline-seed${seed} \
                       --env $TASK \
                       --seed ${seed} \
                       --beta 0.2
```

**Train Safety Critic:**
```bash
python safe_critic.py --expid ${TASK}-baseline-seed${seed} \
                      --env $TASK \
                      --seed ${seed}
```

### 2. Train Safe Policy

```bash
TASK="OfflineCarCircle-v0"
seed=100
python safe_policy.py --expid ${TASK}-baseline-seed${seed} \
                     --env $TASK \
                     --seed ${seed} \
                     --actor_load_path ./Safe_model_factory/${TASK}-baseline-seed${seed}/behavior_ckpt200.pth \
                     --critic_load_path ./Safe_model_factory/${TASK}-baseline-seed${seed}/ \
                     --beta 0.2 \
                     --mode online \
                     --slack_bound 0.1 \
                     --cost_limit 1.0 \
                     --n_policy_epochs 1000
```

### 3. Run All Experiments

For convenience, run the complete pipeline:
```bash
bash Ant.sh
```

## Supported Environments

## Algorithm Overview

Safe Diffusion RL consists of three main components:

1. **Behavior Policy Pretraining**: Learn a diffusion-based behavior policy from offline data
2. **Dual Critic Learning**: Train separate reward and cost critics to evaluate policy performance and safety
3. **Safe Policy Optimization**: Use the behavior policy and critics to learn a safe target policy

Unlike standard offline RL, the safety critic is continuously updated during policy learning to ensure the learned policy respects safety constraints.
